\title{Confidence intervals for (robust) mediation analysis}
\usage{
\method{confint}{bootTestMediation}(object, parm = NULL, level = NULL,
  other = c("boot", "theory"), ...)

\method{confint}{sobelTestMediation}(object, parm = NULL, level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class \code{"\link{testMediation}"}
containing results from (robust) mediation analysis.}

\item{parm}{an integer, character or logical vector specifying the
coefficients for which to extract or compute confidence intervals, or
\code{NULL} to extract or compute confidence intervals for all coefficients.}

\item{level}{for the \code{"bootTestMediation"} method, this is ignored and
the confidence level of the bootstrap confidence interval for the indirect
effect is used.  For the other methods, the confidence level of the
confidence intervals to be computed.  The default is to compute 95\%
confidence intervals.}

\item{other}{a character string specifying how to compute the confidence
interval of the effects other than the indirect effect.  Possible values
are \code{"boot"} (the default) to compute bootstrap confidence intervals
using the normal approximation (i.e., to assume a normal distribution of the
corresponding effect with the standard deviation computed from the bootstrap
replicates), or \code{"theory"} to compute confidence intervals via
statistical theory (e.g., based on a t-distribution the coefficients are
estimated via regression).  Note that this is only relevant for mediation
analysis via a bootstrap test, where the confidence interval of the indirect
effect is always computed via a percentile-based method due to the asymmetry
of its distribution.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments are currently ignored.}
